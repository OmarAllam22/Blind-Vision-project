# Blind-Vision-project
### It is a summer training project to help the blind handle their money using computer vision technique.

### 1) Idea of the project:
We worked on the Egyptian currencies to do the following:

1- Help the blind by computer vision accompained with sound technique to distinguish among:
  * 50-piasteres
  * 1-pound 
  * 5-pounds
  * 10-pounds
  * 20-pounds
  * 50-pounds
  * 100-pounds
  * 200-pounds

2- Help the blind calculate their net amount of money they have.

### 2) Language & Libraries used: 
- Language:

  * python
  
- Libraries:

  * openCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
  * gtts (Google Text-to-Speech Library) 
  * playsound (Python Libraries for playing audios)
  * Numpy (Python Library deals with arrays & matrices)
  * inflect (Python string transformation library to transform numbers to text)
  * os (Python library to interact with the operating system)

### 3) Algorithms used:

* ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) : an openCV built-in algorithm to help in object detection by extracting sets of keypoints and descriptors from the image.
* BF (Brute Force): an openCV built-in algorithm to help in object recognition throug matching the descriptors of the two images and find the best match.
